# UFOs
## Overview of Project

This analysis uses HTML to present an overview on UFO sightings and JavaScript to populate and filter a table based on user input. 

## Results 

This webpage can be used to filter through different criteria based on user input. The user has five different options for filters: date, city, state, country, and shape. If a user wanted the results for all the UFO sightings on January 1st in the shape of a triangle, the user would input 1/1/2010 in the enter date filter search and triangle in the enter shape in the filter search and 4 results would be returned. 

## Summary

-One Drawback 

One drawback of this design is that in order to clear the results of the search, the user has to scroll to the top and click on UFO sightings. This is not intuitive for users, nor is it explained anywhere on the webpage. 

-Two Recommendations 

One recommendation for further development would be a clear filters button so that the user can easily get back to the full data set. 

Another recommendation for further development would be adding another filter for the Comments columns of the table that could filter based on keyword.
